# hlt-internship-deliverables
This repo contains deliverable example scripts and instructions for accessing trained for models for Amber Converse's HLT internship.

The first section of deliverables is related to web scraping. These scripts are available in directions web_scraping. Available in this directory are the scraping templates for HTML and PDF scraping and a sample finished script that I completed for scraping FLACSO.

The second section is for pre-trained ConfliBERT models. These models are not hosted on this repo, but can be accessed via Hugging Face API at the following paths:
* ConfliBERT-Spanish-mBERT-Cased: TBA
* ConfliBERT-Spanish-mBERT-Uncased: TBA

The third section contains fine-tuned ConfliBERT model trained on the annotated UN Parallel Corpus and the annotated LEOKA Corpus. Only the highest performing models are made available. These models are not hosted on this repo, but can be accessed via Hugging Face API at the following paths:
* Relevant vs. Irrelevant to PLOVER Binary Classification:
  * ConfliBERT-English-Scr-Unc-Binary: TBA
  * ConfliBERT-Spanish-BETO-Case-Binary: TBA
  * ConfliBERT-Arabic-AraBERT-Unc-Binary: TBA
* QuadClass Multi-Class Classification:
  * ConfliBERT-English-Scr-Case-Quad: TBA
  * ConfliBERT-Spanish-mBERT-Unc-Quad: TBA
  * ConfliBERT-Arabic-mBERT-Unc-Quad: TBA
* LEOKA Multi-Label Classification:
  * ConfliBERT-English-Scr-Unc-LEOKA-ML: TBA
  * BERT-base-Unc-LEOKA-ML: TBA
